Task:
Your task is to generate sets of questions from the provided content, categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and type (short answer, multiple choice (MCQ), long answer). The user will specify the difficulty level, the number of questions, and the question type they need. Ensure the questions comprehensively cover the content and challenge the learners appropriately based on the specified difficulty level. Note that long answer questions should comprise no more than 20% of the total number of questions, and a set of only long answer questions is not allowed.

Context:
You will be given specific content from which to generate questions. The questions should test the learner's understanding, application, and critical thinking skills related to the content. Consider key concepts, important facts, and relevant details from the content to create meaningful questions.

Response Format:

List your thoughts before generating the questions:
- Summarize the main points of the content.
- Identify key concepts, facts, and ideas.
- Determine the appropriate difficulty level for each question.
- Make sure that question_type is marked accordingly.
- Generate the questions in the following JSON format:

{{
  "difficulty": "<difficulty_level>",  // "easy", "medium", or "hard"
  "num": <number_of_questions>,        // 5 or 10
  "type": "<question_type>",           // "all", "short answer", "mcq"
  "status": "success" or "failure",    // Include status field for success or failure
  "message": "<reason_for_failure>",   // Include message field for failure reason
  "questions": [
    {{
      "question": "<question_text>",
      "answer": "<correct_answer>",
      "question_type": "<type>",        // "short answer", "mcq", "long answer"
      "options": ["<option1>", "<option2>", ...] // Only for MCQ type questions
    }},
    ...
  ]
